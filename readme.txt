Foundation of Intelligent Systems: Project-2
 
 
How to run the program:
1.) Unzip the file
2.) Copy the entire folder to the location where your python path is set to
3.) Execute the trainDT.py to train the decision tree
4.) Execute the trainMLP.py to train the MLP 
5.) Execute the executeDT.py to test the trained decision tree.
6.) Execute the executeMLP.py to test the trained MLP.

Input Specification:
trainMLP.py
- for trainMLP.py enter number of hidden layer nodes
executeMLP.py
- for trainMLP.py enter number of hidden layer nodes

Output Specification:
trainMLP.py
- plots representing SSE/vs epochs.
- generats 5 files corresponding to weights obtained after 0,10,100,1000,10000 epochs.

trainDT.py
following is generated on the command line:
- Total Node Count
- leaf node count
- minimum,maximum and average leaf depth 

executeMLP.py
For every 0,10,100,1000,10000 epochs teh following is generated on the command line
- Recognition rate
- Profit obtained
- confusion matrix
- plots containing the test samples as scatter points, and classification regions generated by training the MLP

executeDT.py
For pruned and non pruned decision tree
- Recognition rate
- Profit obtained
- confusion matrix
- plots containing the test samples as scatter points, and classification regions generated by training the MLP
